*  1 x PIR sensor
*  1 x LED Pack(Red, Blue, Green)
*  1 x 9g 180 degree servo 
*  1 x 16 RGB WS2812 Light Ring 
*  1 x Ultrasonic Sensor
*  1 x Resistor Pack
*  1 x Jumper wire Pack
## About Raspberry Pi Pico
Raspberry Pi Pico is a microcontroller board based on the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller chip.
## What can Raspberry Pi Pico do?
Running on the Raspberry Pi Foundation’s in-house RP2040, it’s a very flexible MCU with plenty of I/O peripherals, including UART, SPI, I2C, ADC, and GPIO.
In addition, the Raspberry Pi Pico’s headline feature, Programmable I/O, allows you to expand the computing possibilities on this tiny MCU by offshoring some processing loads to the 8 state machines on the Pico.
the Raspberry Pi Pico  can runs MicroPython or circuitPython as well.
Arduino has also announced their official port of the Arduino Core to RP2040, which means you will soon be able to leverage the thousands of Arduino libraries and tutorials available.
## What can I build with this Kit ?
*  LED indicator experiment 
*  Using Ultrasonic sensor and LCD1602 to build distance measuring tool
*  Using LED with Buttons to build  Morse code learning machine.
*  Building super cool RGB ws2812 light Ring.
*  Build a wearable device
*  Learn how to control a servo to finish some mechanical control.
*  Using PIR motion sensor to build home automation assistant.
*  all kinds of sensor's combinations and so on...
*  Stay creative...
## Getting Start with Micro Python and Thonny IDE
```bash
All experimental environments are completed under the Raspberry Pi 4B hardware device and Raspberry Pi OS system. It will be very convenient if you use Raspberry Pi to perform the following operations.
```
1.  First, solder the Pin header for your Raspberry Pi Pico.
2.  Download the MicroPython UF2 file from: `https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico/rp2-pico-latest.uf2`
3. Push and hold the `BOOTSEL` button and plug your Pico into the USB port of your Raspberry Pi or other computer. Release the `BOOTSEL` button after your Pico is connected.
It will mount as a Mass Storage Device called `RPI-RP2`.
Drag and drop the MicroPython UF2 file onto the RPI-RP2 volume. Your Pico will reboot. You are now running MicroPython.
if you have any problem with the steps, please refer to : `https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-python-sdk.pdf`
4. Turn on your Raspberry Pi and Plug the Raspberry Pi Pico via MicroUSB cable to USB port.
5. Reinstall `thonny` IDE on your Raspberry Pi by typing follwing command in terminal:
```bash
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get upgrade -y 
sudo apt -y purge thonny
sudo apt -y install thonny
thonny
```
6. Open a new terminal and typing:
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/geeekpi/picokit
cd picokit 
cd demo_code/
```
There are some demo codes in this warehouse, which can be opened by `thonny`, copied and pasted, and then saved to the `main.py` file in Pico.
